// Naive solution
NUMBER
PUSH1 0
MSTORE // Store NUMBER at memory position 0
PUSH1 32
PUSH1 0
RETURN

// Optimised
NUMBER
CALLDATASIZE // I think this assumes function has no calldata, but it's a workaround to PUSH1 0
// Stack looks like `|     0     | block.number `, so MSTORE will store block.number in memory at offset 0
MSTORE 

MSIZE // Push active memory to stack, because we've stored the block number (1 slot), active memory is 1 slot
CALLDATASIZE // Same as above
// Stack looks like `|     0     |      32     `, so RETURN will return whatever is in memory from offset 0 to offset 32
RETURN
